                        <p>Target 14.b focuses on access to resources and markets for small-scale fisheries. In order to guarantee secure access, an enabling environment is necessary which recognizes and protects small-scale fisheries rights. Such an enabling environment has three key features: </p>

                        The indicator variables are chosen from three of five questions on small scale fisheries of FAO Committee of Fisheries questionaire to reflect: 
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Are there any laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies that specifically target or address the small-scale fisheries sector?</li>
                            <li>Are there any ongoing specific initiatives to implement the SSF Guidelines?</li>
                            <li>Does your country have an advisory/consultative body to the Ministry/Department of Fisheries in which fishers/fish workers can participate and contribute to decision-making processes?</li>
                            <p>The national indicator is calculated based on these efforts. It specifically focuses on efforts of promoting and facilitating access rights to small scale fisheries.</p>
