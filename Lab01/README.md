<h1>Project 01: Quantitative Data</h1> 

This segment of the course examines the fundamentals of quantitative data. Students will gain an
understanding of how data is gathered, the databases and other formats by which it can be stored,
the APIs by which it can be accessed, and how it may need to be “cleaned” before use. Design
exercises will use web-based libraries (such as D3, R or Processing) to create visualizations of sample
data sets. Through the exercise, students will learn how to determine meaningful patterns along with
best practices for visualizing them. Students will be given a data set to design static visualizations for
an intended audience. Through the exercise, students will explore the most effective way to
communicate the information. Group discussion and critique of the work will highlight best practices.

<h2>1A: SDG Intro Research</h2>
<h3>Instructions</h3>

Give us an overview of what the goal is about:

What does it actually mean?

3-5 Key statistics?

How might we achieve it?

Provide us with one concrete case study

<h2>1B: Concept & Sketches</h2>
<h3>Instructions</h3>

After reviewing the data and data set imagine 3 different quantitative visualization concepts with 3 different data sets. For each concept, create a hand-drawn sketch and write a paragraph about the idea.

The sketch really should be hand-drawn, not done with a computer. Please design it for a format of 16:9 and make it self explanatory, so that anyone can understand what they are looking at even without your explanation.

The paragraph should include:

Title of the visualization 

What are questions that you want to explore with this visualization?

Which quantitative dataset is used? 

What are the properties of the data set? How many data points, what's the quality of the data etc?

Which visualization method is used and why?

<h2>1C: Design mockup and first prototype</h2>
<h3>Details</h3>
After the first design review, decide for one of the concepts for this assignment. You now have two parallel work streams: Design and code. For this assignment create a prototype for both:

<h3>Design Mockup</h3>

Create a high fidelity version of the design you want to create

Include the data visualization, a title, a legend and the relevant scales and units

Carefully consider colors, scale, composition and typography

Be able to answer why you picked any of the above

All designs should be created with a 16:9 aspect ratio in mind (1920x1080px)

<h3>Code Prototype</h3>

Gather all the data you want to use or build a system to query it using the api

Make sure the data is structured in the right way for your visualization

Build a prototype that loads the data and displays it visually on the screen

Imagine a plan to get to your high fidelity mockup in code

<h2>1D: Final Design, Prototype, and Presentation</h2>

<h3>Details</h3>
After the second review of your project, incorporate the feedback and refine your design. 

Re-evaluate your visual design choices and refine all aspects of it in detail (pixel perfect design): Visualization method, composition, color, contrast, typography, hierarchy

Fix outstanding bugs and missing features in the code version of your project

Upload the working version of your project to your github.io page

Create a set of 2-5 screenshots that work in a slide presentation (16:9, 1920x1080px) 

Create a presentation about this project that describes the project

Initial motivation and question (1-3 slides, 1-2min)

Process (only if helpful, necessary)

Visualization (Still and in code)

Next steps, learnings and open questions

Be prepared to present this work live to a public audience
