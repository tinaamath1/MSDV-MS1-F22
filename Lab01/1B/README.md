Women in Senior & Middle Managerial Positions 5.5.2
![](Lab01/1B/images/Women%20in%20Managerial%20Positions.jpg)

<b>Title:</b> Proportion of Women in Senior & Managerial Positions<br />
<b>Questions:</b><br />Was there an overall increase in women in managerial positions during this period?<br />
           How does this proportion compare in countries with female leaders vs. male leaders?<br />
           How does it compare with counties that have a more desirable parental leave?<br />
<b>Quantitative Dataset:</b> Indicator 5.5.2<br />
<b>How many data points, what is the quality:</b> I am focusing on 6 countries and there are 15 years of data. It is a quantitative dataset.<br />
<b>Which data visualization method and why:</b> I noticed that countries values changed by a few tenths places or ones over the 15 year period. It appeared that each consecutive year showed gradual change and I thought about how to show gradual change that would look significant compared to the other years. So, I chose a heat map to display the changes in proportions. Instead of using grayscale I would use a gradient that had two different colors. Maybe going from red to green. I think this will better show a better display of change. 

Beach Litter 14.1.1

<b>Title</b>: Beach Litter Originating from National Land- based Sources that ends in Oceans (Tonnes)<br />
<b>Questions:</b><br /> How much do we see countries surrounded by water contributing?<br />
            How does countries like Korea who have strict garbage & recycling sorting compare?<br />
<b>Quantitative Dataset:</b> 14.1.1<br />
<b>How many data sets, what is the quality:</b> This dataset is quantiative dataset. I chose four countries and data starts from 2017 and ends 2021.<br />
<b>Which data visualization method and why:</b> I chose two visualizaitons here. The top visualization is a stream graph and the bottom is a simple line graph which I could fill the area. I have never worked with a stream graph before and It seems interesting that area shows value. I am not confident that I can achieve that with this data set in a meaningful way. I thought that using different shades of blue would be a nice way to show an ocean but maybe waste should be used instead to show a more compelling picture. I thought about filling in the area of the line graph on the bottom visualization. Again, this is to represent ocean waves. I do not know if I should include more countries and have information about each country's ocean waste management as an interactive element. 

Maternal Mortality 3.1.1
![](Lab01/1B/images/Maternal%20Mortality.jpg)

<b>Title:</b> Maternal Mortality Rate<br />
<b>Questions:</b><br /> Does USA mortality need to dramatically improve?<br />
<b>Quantitative Dataset:</b> 3.1.1<br />
<b>How many data sets, what is the quality:</b> This is a quantitative dataset. I chose 5 countries, which had 17 years worth of data. I selected four countries that provided great care for mothers to compare to the US. 
<b>Which data visualization method and why:</b> I really want to show how greatly the four countries with the best maternal health care(Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark) compared to the US in order to display need for change. While I like that the first visualization shows movement, I think the information does not pass along as clearly as the second visualization. While the viewer can see changes from beginning to end it can't see the changes inbetween. The second visualization is a radar chart. I think the interactive feature will be a good way to show dramatic change over time and show that while other countries are decreaing in their maternal mortality rate, the US continues to increase. I think it would be helpful to include countries other than Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark as they are all in Europe.
