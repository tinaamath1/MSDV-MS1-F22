<h1> Global CO2 Emissions</h1>

<p> The title of my visualization (subject to change) is called Global CO2 Emissions. I was inspired to do this project from a data visualization done by [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/carbon-footprint-food-methane). I thought this told an imporant story about how human food production and consupmtion effect the environemnt. I wanted to show something similar with the UN data that was available. I found greenhouse gas emissions data from [UN Clinate Change] (https://unfccc.int/topics/mitigation/resources/registry-and-data/ghg-data-from-unfccc) which offer data granularly by category, three types of greenhouse gases, and countries. This visualization will answer: Which country contributes to the largest amount of CO2 emissions? What industry contributes to carbon dioxide emissions the most?</p>

<p> I am creating an interactive verison of this because I believe that there is a considerable amount of informaiton that could overwhelm a user if it were static or cause the designer to leave out data. </p>
